# cpp-matrixlibrary
A custom-made CPP library for handling matrices.

Function available:

Constructors: 

matrix<T> (r, c): create a r x c matrix

matrix<T> (r, c, T** input) : r x c matrix generated by 2-D arrat input

matrix<T> (r, c, T * input) : r x c matrix generated by list of elements

Linear Row Operations:

op1 (int r, T lamda)          : row[r] -> row[r] x lamda

op2 (int r1, int r2, T lamda) : row[r1] -> row[r1] + lamda x row[r2]

swap(int r1, int r2)          : row interchange

Operators Overloaded:

Scalar, matrix Multiplication, ==, -, <<

'~' operator is used for transpose

Other functions:

matrix<T> reduced(const matrix<T> &A) : Reduced form of the given matrix

matrix<T> C_space(const matrix<T> &A) : Column Space in matrix form.

int rank(const matrix<T> &A): give the rank of the matrix A

Please refer the example file "example.cpp".

The main file needs to include:
```
#include"matrix.h"
```
Also the file must be placed in the working directory.
First store the elements of the matrix in an array. Then construct the matrix using the constructor:
```
double A[]= {2,1,1,4,-6,0,-2,7,2};
matrix<double> P(3,3,A);
```
The last line creates a 3x3 matrix, P with elements as read from the array A.
```
cout<<P<<endl;
```
The matrix P will be printed out.
```
( 2 1 1 )
( 4 -6 0 )
( -2 7 2 )
```

```
cout<<reduced(P)<<endl;
cout<<C_space(P)<<endl;
```
reduced() and C_space() are functions defined in library which return reduced form of P and the column Space of P(in matrix form) respectively.Hence, the following will be printed.
```
( 2 0 0 )
( 0 1 -0 )
( 0 0 1 )

( 2 0 0 )
( 0 1 0 )
( 0 0 1 )
```
The following line will print 3 which is the rank of the matrix P.
```
cout<<rank(P);
Output==> 3
```
